# Jumpstarter Driver for Software driven flashing

Some platforms provide on-board storage which cannot be externally tapped or
flashed. Flashing those devices during testing requires driving the DUT into the
right state through the bootloader or other means so the storage contents can be
transferred through network into the internal storage.

This driver provides a set of base drivers and clients to implement the
FlasherInterface for those target platforms, as well as some specific
implementations.
