    """ Base class for Jumpstarter test cases in pytest

This class provides a client fixture that can be used to interact with
Jumpstarter services in test cases.

Looks for the `JUMPSTARTER_HOST` environment variable to connect to an
established Jumpstarter shell, otherwise it will try to acquire a lease
for a single exporter using the filter_labels annotation.
i.e.:
