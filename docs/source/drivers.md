# Jumpstarter Drivers

Jumpstarter uses Python modules called drivers to interact with the hardware
interfaces connected to the Device Under Test (DUT).

Similar to the drivers used by your operating system, drivers in Jumpstarter
enable the us to interact with hardware and provide abstractions that makethat
it easier to use.

Drivers in Jumpstarter consist of three components:

- `Driver` - Implements the logic to configure and use the interface(s) provided
by the host system. e.g. a TCP port.
- `DriverInterface` - Defines the contract between the driver client and the
driver itself.
- `DriverClient` - Provides a user-friendly interface that can be used byclients
to interact with the underlying `Driver` either locally or remotely over the network.

Drivers follow a client/server model similar to the client and exporter.
The exporter instance runs the `Driver` itself to interact with the hardware.
Clients use a `DriverClient` class to interact with the driver through the
contract defined in the `DriverInterface`.

When a client connects to the exporter and requests a lease, a session is created
for each set of tests to execute. Within the session, the specified `Driver`
subclass is instantiated for each of the configured interfaces defined in the
exporter configuration. These driver instances live throughout the duration of
the session and can run setup/teardown logic and keep state internally for that
session.

On the client side, a `DriverClient` subclass is instantiated for each interface
that is exported by the exporter. The `DriverClient` is used to interact with
each `Driver` through the defined `DriverInterface` for each driver. As the
client may not be on the same machine as the exporter, the `DriverClient`
classes are loaded dynamically if they are specified in the list of allowed
packages.

To keep the client/server library versions in sync, it is recommended to not make
breaking changes to the `DriverInterface`. Only add new methods when necessary and
avoid changing the method signatures. If breaking changes are required, new
`MyDriverInterfaceV2`, `MyDriverClientV2`, and `MyDriverV2` classes can be created
within the same Python module.
