### Making Changes

- Focus on a single issue.
- Follow code style (validate with `make lint`, fix with `make lint-fix`)
- Perform static type checking with (`make ty-pkg-${package_name}`)
- Add tests and update documentation. New drivers/features need tests and docs.
- Verify all tests pass (`make test-pkg-${package_name}` or `make test`)

### Commit Messages

- Use clear, descriptive messages
- Reference issue numbers when applicable
- Follow conventional commit format when possible

### Pull Requests

- Provide a clear description
- Link to relevant issues
- Ensure all tests pass

## Types of Contributions

### Code Contributions

We welcome bug fixes, features, and improvements to the core codebase.

### Contributing Drivers

To create a new driver scaffold:

```console
$ ./__templates__/create_driver.sh driver_package DriverClass "Your Name" "your.email@example.com"
```

For private drivers, consider forking our
[jumpstarter-driver-template](https://github.com/jumpstarter-dev/jumpstarter-driver-template).

Test your driver: `make pkg-test-${package_name}`

### Contributing Documentation

Documentation recommended practices:

- Use clear, concise language
- Include practical examples
- Break up text with headers, lists, and code blocks
- Target both beginners and advanced users
