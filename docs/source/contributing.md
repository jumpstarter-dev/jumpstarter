## Contribution Guidelines

### Making Changes

- Focus on a single issue.
- Follow code style (validate with `make lint`, fix with `make lint-fix`)
- Perform static type checking with (`make ty-pkg-${package_name}`)
- Add tests and update documentation. New drivers/features need tests and docs.
- Verify all tests pass (`make test-pkg-${package_name}` or `make test`)

### Commit Messages

- Use clear, descriptive messages
- Reference issue numbers when applicable
- Follow conventional commit format when possible

### Pull Requests

- Provide a clear description
- Link to relevant issues
- Ensure all tests pass

## Types of Contributions

### Code Contributions

We welcome bug fixes, features, and improvements to the core codebase.


## AI Assistants

This project accepts contributions from AI assistants, although you should be careful when creating code from AI assistants,
and figure out if the code you are submitting could infringe any licensing, for example, reusing code from other incompatible
GPL licenses, you should do your due diligence.

This project includes cursor rules to help Cursor AI understand our codebase and development patterns. When working with Cursor AI:

- **Driver Creation**: If asked to create a new driver, Cursor will guide you through the process using our `create_driver.sh` script
- **Code Style**: Cursor will follow our established patterns and conventions
- **Testing**: Cursor will remind you to add tests and run our test suite

The cursor rules are located in `.cursor/rules/` directory, with specific guidance for driver creation in `.cursor/rules/creating-new-drivers.mdc`.


### Contributing Drivers

To create a new driver scaffold:

```console
$ ./__templates__/create_driver.sh driver_package DriverClass "Your Name" "your.email@example.com"
```

For private drivers, consider forking our
[jumpstarter-driver-template](https://github.com/jumpstarter-dev/jumpstarter-driver-template).

Test your driver: `make pkg-test-${package_name}`

### Contributing Documentation

Jumpstarter uses Sphinx with Markdown. Build and preview locally:

```console
$ make docs-serve
```

Documentation recommended practices:

- Use clear, concise language
- Include practical examples
- Break up text with headers, lists, and code blocks
- Target both beginners and advanced users
