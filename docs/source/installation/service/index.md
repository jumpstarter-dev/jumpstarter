# Service

To manage your Jumpstarter lab from Kubernetes, the Jumpstarter Service must be
installed in your cluster.

## Prerequisites

- A *Kubernetes* cluster.
- [Kubectl](https://www.downloadkubernetes.com/)
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)

```{tip}
If you don't have a Kubernetes cluster you can use a local cluster for testing,
such as [`kind`](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io), [`minikube`](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io), or [`OpenShift Local`](https://developers.redhat.com/products/openshift-local/overview).
```

## Installation

The service installation is very similar between targets, but there are some
specifics to each target. Please select the appropriate guide for your target:


```{toctree}
:maxdepth: 1
kubernetes-helm.md
openshift-helm.md
openshift-argocd.md
kind-helm.md
minikube-helm.md
```
