# OIDC Authentication

Jumpstarter authenticates clients and exporters with internally issued JWT
tokens by default, it can also be configured to use external OpenID Connect
(OIDC) providers.

To use OIDC with you Jumpstarter installation, set the helm value
`jumpstarter-controller.authenticationConfiguration` to a valid
`AuthenticationConfiguration` yaml configuration.

## Examples

### Keycloak

Create a new keycloak client for the jumpstarter cli, set `Client ID` to
`jumpstarter-cli`, `Valid redirect URIs` to `http://localhost/callback` and
leave the remaining fields as default. Use the following snippet as
`jumpstarter-controller.authenticationConfiguration` during Jumpstarter
installation.

```yaml
apiVersion: jumpstarter.dev/v1alpha1
kind: AuthenticationConfiguration
jwt:
- issuer:
    url: https://<keycloak domain>/realms/<realm name> # https is mandatory
    certificateAuthority: <PEM encoded CA certificates> # if using self-signed certificate
    audiences:
    - jumpstarter-cli
  claimMappings:
    # use user ID prefixed with "keycloak:" as username
    # e.g. keycloak:example-user
    username:
      claim: preferred_username
      prefix: "keycloak:"
```

Then proceed to create clients and exporters with the `jmp admin create`
commands, set their corresponding OIDC username with the `--oidc-username` flag,
e.g. `jmp admin create client test-client --oidc-username keycloak:developer-1`.
Be sure to prefix usernames with "keycloak:", as previously configured.

Finally, instruct the users to login with the following commands

```
# for clients
jmp login --client <client alias> --endpoint <jumpstarter controller endpoint> \
  --namespace <namespace> --name <client name> \
  --issuer https://<keycloak domain>/realms/<realm name>
# without additional options, the users would be directed to login with the web browser
# or the username and password can be directly specified for non-interactive login
  --username <username> --password <password>
# or a token for machine to machine authentication, useful in CI environments
  --token <token>

# for exporters
jmp login --exporter <exporter alias> --endpoint <jumpstarter controller endpoint> \
  --namespace <namespace> --name <exporter name> \
  --issuer https://<keycloak domain>/realms/<realm name>
# --username, --password and --token are also accepted
```

### Dex (for authenticating with kubernetes Service Accounts)

Initialize a self-signed CA and sign certificate for dex

```shell
easyrsa init-pki
easyrsa --no-pass build-ca
easyrsa --no-pass build-server-full dex.dex.svc.cluster.local

# import certificate into secret
kubectl create namespace dex
kubectl -n dex create secret tls dex-tls \
  --cert=pki/issued/dex.dex.svc.cluster.local.crt \
  --key=pki/private/dex.dex.svc.cluster.local.key
```

Install dex with helm

```yaml
# dex.values.yaml
https:
  enabled: true
config:
  issuer: https://dex.dex.svc.cluster.local:5556
  web:
    tlsCert: /etc/dex/tls/tls.crt
    tlsKey: /etc/dex/tls/tls.key
  storage:
    type: kubernetes
    config:
      inCluster: true
  staticClients:
    - id: jumpstarter-cli
      name: Jumpstarter CLI
      public: true
  connectors:
    - name: kubernetes
      type: oidc
      id: kubernetes
      config:
        # kubectl get --raw /.well-known/openid-configuration | jq -r '.issuer'
        issuer: "https://kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local"
        rootCAs:
          - /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/ca.crt
        userNameKey: sub
        scopes:
          - profile
volumes:
  - name: tls
    secret:
      secretName: dex-tls
volumeMounts:
  - name: tls
    mountPath: /etc/dex/tls
service:
  type: ClusterIP
  ports:
    http:
      port: 5554
    https:
      port: 5556
```

```shell
# Ensure OIDC discovery URLs do not require authentication
kubectl create clusterrolebinding oidc-reviewer  \
 --clusterrole=system:service-account-issuer-discovery \
 --group=system:unauthenticated

helm repo add dex https://charts.dexidp.io
helm install --namespace dex --wait -f dex.values.yaml dex dex/dex
```

Configure Jumpstarter to trust dex by using the following snippet as
`jumpstarter-controller.authenticationConfiguration` during Jumpstarter
installation.

```yaml
apiVersion: jumpstarter.dev/v1alpha1
kind: AuthenticationConfiguration
jwt:
  - issuer:
      url: https://dex.dex.svc.cluster.local:5556
      audiences:
      - jumpstarter-cli
      audienceMatchPolicy: MatchAny
      certificateAuthority: |
        <content of pki/ca.crt>
    claimMappings:
      username:
        claim: "name"
        prefix: "dex:"
```

Then proceed to create clients and exporters with the `jmp admin create`
commands, set their corresponding OIDC username with the `--oidc-username` flag,
e.g. `jmp admin create exporter test-exporter --oidc-username
dex:system:serviceaccount:default:test-service-account`. Just prefix the full
service account name with "dex:", as previously configured.

Finally, instruct the users to login with the following commands in pods
configured with proper service accounts.

```
# for clients
jmp login --client <client alias> --endpoint <jumpstarter controller endpoint> \
  --namespace <namespace> --name <client name> \
  --issuer https://dex.dex.svc.cluster.local:5556 \
  --connector-id kubernetes \
  --token $(cat /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token)

# for exporters
jmp login --exporter <exporter alias> --endpoint <jumpstarter controller endpoint> \
  --namespace <namespace> --name <exporter name> \
  --issuer https://dex.dex.svc.cluster.local:5556 \
  --connector-id kubernetes \
  --token $(cat /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token)
```
