Jumpstarter is a free and open source testing tool that bridges the gap between
development workflows and deployment environments. It enables you to test your
software stack consistently across both real hardware and virtual environments
using cloud native principles. See Jumpstarter in action:

One tool, any target. Jumpstarter decouples devices from test runners, letting
you use identical automation scripts everywhere - your *Makefile* for device
testing.
