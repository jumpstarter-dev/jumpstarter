# Welcome to Jumpstarter

Jumpstarter is a free and open-source testing tool that enables you to test your software stack on both real hardware and virtual environments using CI/CD principles. It provides powerful testing tools that leverage Cloud Native principles, modern CI/CD technologies, and open standards for the next generation of edge devices, whether physical or emulated.

## Device Automation Made Simple

Jumpstarter decouples your target devices (physical or virtual) from test runners, development machines, and CI/CD pipelines, allowing you to use the same automation scripts, commands, and processes everywhere. Think of it as a *Makefile* for device automation that can run locally on your machine or distributed across your infrastructure.
