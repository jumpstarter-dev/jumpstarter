Jumpstarter is a free and open source testing tool that bridges the gap between development workflows and deployment environments. It enables you to test your software stack consistently across both real hardware and virtual environments using cloud native principles. By decoupling your target devices (physical or virtual) from test runners, development machines, and CI/CD pipelines, Jumpstarter allows you to use the same automation scripts everywhere - like a *Makefile* for device automation.
