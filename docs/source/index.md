Jumpstarter is a free and open source testing tool that bridges the gap between
development workflows and deployment environments. It enables you to test your
software stack consistently across both real hardware and virtual environments
using cloud native principles.

By decoupling your target devices (physical or virtual) from test runners,
development machines, and CI/CD pipelines, Jumpstarter allows you to use the
same automation scripts everywhere - like a *Makefile* for device automation.
