# Getting Started

This section provides hands-on guides to start using Jumpstarter in your own
environment. The guides cover:

- [Installation](installation/index.md): Setting up Jumpstarter packages and
  services
- [Configuration](configuration/index.md): Configuring clients, exporters, and
  authentication
- [Guides](guides/index.md): Running your first tests and integrating with your
  development workflow

These guides support both local-mode for individual development and
distributed-mode for team environments with shared hardware resources.
