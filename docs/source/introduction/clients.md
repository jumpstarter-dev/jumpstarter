# Clients

To interact with your target device from a development machine or through a
CI/CD pipeline, you must use a Jumpstarter client. The Python client can be used
either as a library or as a [CLI tool](../reference/man-pages/index.md).

## Types of Clients

Jumpstarter supports two types of client configurations: *local* and *remote*.

### Local Clients

When using Jumpstarter in *local-only* mode, you can use the local client
functionality to directly access your hardware. The local client will
automatically use any drivers that are registered without the need for an
exporter instance running in the background.

### Remote Clients

When using Jumpstarter in *distributed* mode, the client must be configured to
connect to an instance of the Service that can authenticate and route requests
to the appropriate exporter instance.

The following parameters are required to set up a remote client:

- The URL of a Service endpoint to connect to
- An authentication token generated by the Service

```{note}
The endpoint must be accessible from your client machine to communicate
with the Service.
