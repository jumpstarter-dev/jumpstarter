# Command-Line Interface
To simplify the management and operation of Jumpstarter, we provide several command-line tools for different use cases. These CLI tools can also be installed together through the `jmpstarter-cli` package and accessed using the `jmp` command for simplicity.

Each tool can also be installed separately for users who want to reduce the dependencies on their developer machine or an embedded exporter with limited available resources.
