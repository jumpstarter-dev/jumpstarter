Jumpstarter is a cloud-native testing tool that enables you to test your
software on real hardware using CI/CD principles.

## Highlights

- 🐍 Write tests using Python and tools such as Pytest.
- 🚀 Integrates directly with your existing CI/CD pipelines.
- ☸️ Deploys directly on your existing Kubernetes cluster.
- 🛠️ Access hardware devices through modular driver plugins.
- ❇️ Develop code and write tests locally with remote hardware access.
- 🏢 Enterprise-grade authentication support with OpenID Connect.
- 💻 Easy-to-use CLI tool for managing hardware and running tests.

Automated hardware testing, often called Hardware-in-the-Loop (HiL) has been around for years in industries such as automotive and manufacturing, however, these tools are often expensive and/or inaccessible to hobbyists and open-source projects.

Jumpstarter aims to provide powerful hardware testing tools that leverage
[Cloud Native](https://www.cncf.io/) principles, modern CI/CD technologies,
and open standards for the next generation of edge devices.
