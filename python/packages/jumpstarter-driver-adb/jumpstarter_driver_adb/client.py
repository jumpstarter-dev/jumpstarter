            """ADB tunneling and device access.

            Wraps the local adb binary to work against a remote ADB server
            tunneled through Jumpstarter. The exporter's ADB server is
            automatically tunneled to a local port, and environment variables
            ANDROID_ADB_SERVER_ADDRESS and ANDROID_ADB_SERVER_PORT are set so
            the local adb binary communicates through the tunnel.

            All standard adb commands (shell, install, push, pull, logcat,
            start-server, kill-server, connect, disconnect, etc.) are passed
            through directly to the remote ADB server.

            If a persistent tunnel is already running (from a previous
            `j adb tunnel`), commands will reuse it instead of creating
            a new ephemeral tunnel.

            \b
            Jumpstarter-specific commands:
              attach    Add the exporter's devices to the ADB server this machine
                        already uses, via plain `adb connect`. Works when you do
                        NOT own that server -- Android Studio keeps 5037 and
                        respawns it in ~3s if killed, so it cannot be taken over.
                        No local ADB server is needed either: adb starts one if
                        there is none. Devices appear in Studio's chooser with no
                        configuration. Defaults to every usable device; name
                        serials to pick. Blocks until Ctrl+C, then detaches
                        cleanly. Pass --hotplug to keep following devices that
                        come and go while it runs.
              tunnel    Create a persistent ADB tunnel to a local port
                        (auto-assigned by default, use -P to pick a specific
                        port). Other j adb commands will automatically reuse
                        the tunnel. For native adb or external tools, export
                        the env vars printed by the command.

            \b
            Unsupported commands:
              nodaemon  Not supported (would start a local server, ignoring
                        the tunnel).
