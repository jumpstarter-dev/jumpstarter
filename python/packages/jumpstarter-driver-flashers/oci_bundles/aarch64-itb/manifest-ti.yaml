# removed for now, even if it's our documented procedure, if
# the board is configured to boot from sd or emmc (and not SPI), and
# the flashing of the final image fails, it will result in an un-bootable
# system -> lab admin going to the site and re-flashing SD, this can
# only be avoided by using something like sdwire
#
#  preflash_commands:
