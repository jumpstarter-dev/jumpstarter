# Driver Packages

Driver packages from the [contrib](https://github.com/jumpstarter-dev/jumpstarter/tree/main/contrib)
directory are additional drivers that are not part of the jumpstarter core package, we package
them separately to keep the core as lightweight and dependency-free as possible.

Drivers packages from the [drivers](https://github.com/jumpstarter-dev/jumpstarter/tree/main/jumpstarter/drivers) directory are drivers that are part of the jumpstarter core package.
