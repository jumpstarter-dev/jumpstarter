# Clients

To interact with your target device from a development machine or through a
CI/CD pipeline, you must use a Jumpstarter client.

The Python client can be used either as a library through a testing tool such as
[pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) or as a [CLI
tool](../cli/index.md).

## Types of Clients

Jumpstarter supports two types of client configurations: local and remote.

### Local Clients

When using Jumpstarter in *local-only* mode, you can use the local client
functionality to directly access your hardware. The local client will
automatically use any drivers that are registered without the need for an
exporter instance running in the background.

You can get started with a local client by following the [Setup a Local
Client](../getting-started/setup-local-exporter.md) guide.

### Remote Clients

When using Jumpstarter in *distributed* mode, the client must be configured to
connect to an instance of the Service that can authenticate and
route requests to the appropriate exporter instance.

The following parameters are required to set up a remote client:
- The URL of a Service endpoint to connect to
- An authentication token generated by the Service

```{note}
The endpoint must be accessible from your client machine to communicate
with the Service.
```

You can get started with a remote client by following the [Setup a Remote
Client](../getting-started/setup-exporter-client.md) guide.

We will discuss how remote clients connect to exporters in the next section on
the [Service](./service.md).
