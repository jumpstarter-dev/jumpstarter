# Jumpstarter Enhancement Proposals (JEPs)

This directory contains the Jumpstarter Enhancement Proposals — design documents
that describe significant changes to the Jumpstarter project.

## What is a JEP?

A JEP is a design document that proposes a new feature, process change, or
architectural decision for the Jumpstarter hardware-in-the-loop testing
framework. JEPs provide a transparent, structured process for the community to
propose, discuss, and decide on substantial changes.

For the full process definition, see [JEP-0000](JEP-0000-jep-process.md).

## Quick Start

1. Read [JEP-0000](JEP-0000-jep-process.md) to understand when a JEP is needed.
2. Socialize your idea in [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#jumpstarter:matrix.org)
   or at the [weekly meeting](https://meet.google.com/gzd-hhbd-hpu).
3. Create a branch and add your JEP markdown file to the `python/docs/source/internal/jeps/` directory
   using the [JEP-NNNN-template.md](JEP-NNNN-template.md) as a starting point.
4. Open a pull request. The PR serves as the primary venue for discussion,
   allowing inline review comments on the JEP text.
