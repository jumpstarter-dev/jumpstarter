# Project Structure

This project follows a monorepo structure with a top-level `pyproject.toml` that manages all packages using UV workspace.

## Top-Level Structure

```
jumpstarter/
├── python/                 # Python workspace root
│   ├── pyproject.toml      # Main workspace configuration
│   ├── packages/           # All Python packages
│   ├── examples/           # Example applications
│   ├── docs/               # Documentation
│   └── __templates__/      # Templates for creating new drivers
├── controller/             # Controller components
├── protocol/               # Protocol definitions
└── .cursor/                # Cursor AI rules
```

## Workspace Configuration

The project uses **UV workspace** for dependency management:

- **Top-level `python/pyproject.toml`**: Defines the workspace and includes all packages
- **Workspace members**: All packages in `python/packages/*` and `python/examples/*` are included
- **Dependency groups**: Shared development dependencies (docs, dev)
- **Tool configuration**: Ruff, typos, coverage, pytest settings

## Package Structure

### Core Packages

- **`jumpstarter/`**: Main library with client, config, and common functionality
- **`jumpstarter-protocol/`**: gRPC protocol definitions (excluded from linting)
- **`jumpstarter-kubernetes/`**: Kubernetes integration
- **`jumpstarter-testing/`**: Testing utilities
- **`jumpstarter-imagehash/`**: Image hashing utilities

### CLI Packages

- **`jumpstarter-cli/`**: Main CLI application
- **`jumpstarter-cli-admin/`**: Administrative CLI commands
- **`jumpstarter-cli-common/`**: Shared CLI utilities
- **`jumpstarter-cli-driver/`**: Driver-specific CLI commands

### Driver Packages

All driver packages follow the pattern `jumpstarter-driver-<name>/`:

- **`jumpstarter-driver-network/`**: Network interface drivers (TCP, UDP, Unix, etc.)
- **`jumpstarter-driver-power/`**: Power management drivers
- **`jumpstarter-driver-*`**: Various hardware-specific drivers

### Utility Packages

- **`jumpstarter-all/`**: Meta-package that includes all components
- **`hatch-pin-jumpstarter/`**: Custom Hatch build hook

## Package Structure

Each package follows this structure:

```
python/packages/jumpstarter-driver-<name>/
├── jumpstarter_driver_<name>/    # Main Python package
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── driver.py                 # Driver implementation
│   ├── client.py                 # Client implementation
│   └── driver_test.py           # Tests
├── examples/                     # Example configurations
│   └── exporter.yaml
├── pyproject.toml               # Package configuration
├── README.md                    # Package documentation
└── .gitignore
```

## Package Configuration

Each package's `pyproject.toml` includes:

- **Project metadata**: Name, description, authors, license, please note that this repo only accepts Apache-2.0 license.
- **Dependencies**: Runtime and development dependencies
- **Entry points**: Driver and adapter registrations
- **Build system**: Hatch with custom hooks
- **Version management**: VCS-based versioning from root

## Examples Structure

```
python/examples/
├── automotive/                  # Automotive testing example
│   ├── jumpstarter_example_automotive/
│   ├── pyproject.toml
│   └── README.md
└── soc-pytest/                 # SoC testing example
    ├── jumpstarter_example_soc_pytest/
    ├── pyproject.toml
    └── README.md
```

## Development Workflow

### Creating New Packages

1. **Drivers**: Use `./python/__templates__/create_driver.sh` (see creating-new-drivers.mdc)
2. **Other packages**: Create manually following existing patterns

### Package Dependencies

- **Core packages**: Depend on `jumpstarter-protocol`
- **Driver packages**: Depend on `jumpstarter` and specific hardware libraries
- **CLI packages**: Depend on `jumpstarter` and `jumpstarter-cli-common`
- **Examples**: Depend on relevant driver packages

### Testing

- **Package tests**: `make test-pkg-<package_name>`
- **All tests**: `make test`
- **Coverage**: Configured per package with HTML and XML reports

### Linting and Formatting

- **Ruff**: Code formatting and linting (excludes `jumpstarter-protocol`), `make lint` and `make lint-fix` are available.
- **Typos**: Spell checking
- **Pre-commit**: Automated checks

## Key Conventions

1. **Naming**: Package names use hyphens, module names use underscores
2. **Entry points**: Drivers register via `jumpstarter.drivers` entry point
3. **Versioning**: All packages share the same version from VCS
4. **Documentation**: Each package has its own README.md, and when it's a driver we make a symlink in `python/docs/source/reference/package-apis/drivers/` pointing to the README.md for the driver.
5. **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage required, but always try to focus on starting a server and client to test it e2e. Mock sometimes when there is too much dependency on system tools/services/compatibility issues between MacOs/Linux.
6. **Dependencies**: Minimal, focused dependencies per package

## Build and Distribution

- **Build system**: Hatch with custom `hatch-pin-jumpstarter` hook
- **Version source**: VCS (Git) with root-level version management
- **Distribution**: Individual packages published separately
- **Workspace**: UV manages dependencies across all packages

## Running tests

When running tests you should use the `make pkg-test-<package_name>` command.

## Running type checking

When running type checking you should use the `make pkg-ty-<package_name>` command,
never invoke pytest manually. Use this because it will be more reliable and
install the right dependencies.

## Running linting

When running linting you should use the `make lint-fix`command.

## Running python manually

If you need to run python code manually to check if it works, you should use `uv run python3`
to make sure you get the venv from uv, you may need to run `make sync` first to get all
the dependencies in place.
