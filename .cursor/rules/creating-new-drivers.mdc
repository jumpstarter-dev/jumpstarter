# Creating New Drivers

When asked to create a new driver, follow these steps:

## 1. Use the Driver Creation Script
Always use the provided script: `./python/__templates__/create_driver.sh`

## 2. Required Information
Before creating a driver, ask the user for:
- **Driver Package Name**: The package name (e.g., `mydriver`, `custom-power`, `device-controller`)
  - Should be lowercase with hyphens for multi-word names
  - Examples from existing drivers: `network`, `iscsi`, `ridesx`, `opendal`, `shell`, `gpiod`, `http-power`, `tasmota`, `tftp`, `uboot`, `snmp`, `sdwire`, `probe-rs`, `can`, `composite`, `corellium`, `dutlink`, `energenie`, `flashers`, `http`, `power`, `pyserial`, `qemu`, `ustreamer`, `yepkit`
- **Driver Class Name**: The main driver class in CamelCase (e.g., `MyDriver`, `CustomPower`, `DeviceController`)
  - Should be descriptive and end with appropriate suffix based on functionality
  - Examples: `TcpNetwork`, `ISCSI`, `RideSXDriver`, `Opendal`, `Shell`, `HttpPower`, `TasmotaPower`, `Tftp`, `UbootConsole`, `SNMPServer`, `SDWire`, `ProbeRs`, `Can`, `Composite`, `Corellium`, `Dutlink`, `EnerGenie`, `QemuFlasher`, `UStreamer`, `Ykush`
- **Author Name**: Full name of the author
- **Author Email**: Email address of the author

## 3. Command Format
```bash
./python/__templates__/create_driver.sh <driver_package> <DriverClass> "<Author Name>" "<author@email.com>"
```
Always try to obtain the Author Name and Email from git, by checking the git configuration.
## 4. Examples
```bash
# Network driver
./python/__templates__/create_driver.sh network TcpNetwork "John Doe" "john@example.com"

# Power management driver
./python/__templates__/create_driver.sh custom-power CustomPowerDriver "Jane Smith" "jane@example.com"

# Device control driver
./python/__templates__/create_driver.sh device-controller DeviceController "Bob Wilson" "bob@example.com"
```

## 5. After Creation
Once the driver is created:
1. Navigate to the new driver directory: `python/packages/jumpstarter-driver-<driver_package>/`
2. Review the generated files and customize as needed
3. Implement the driver logic in `driver.py`
4. Add tests in `driver_test.py`
5. Update the README.md with specific documentation
6. Test the driver: `make pkg-test-<driver_package>`

## 6. Driver Naming Conventions
- **Package names**: lowercase with hyphens (e.g., `my-driver`)
- **Class names**: CamelCase with descriptive suffixes:
  - Power drivers: `*Power` (e.g., `TasmotaPower`, `HttpPower`)
  - Network drivers: `*Network` (e.g., `TcpNetwork`, `UdpNetwork`)
  - Flasher drivers: `*Flasher` (e.g., `QemuFlasher`)
  - Console drivers: `*Console` (e.g., `UbootConsole`)
  - Server drivers: `*Server` (e.g., `HttpServer`, `SNMPServer`)
  - Generic drivers: descriptive name (e.g., `ISCSI`, `Shell`, `Tftp`)

## 7. Directory Structure
The script creates:
```
python/packages/jumpstarter-driver-<driver_package>/
├── jumpstarter_driver_<driver_package>/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── client.py
│   ├── driver.py
│   └── driver_test.py
├── examples/
│   └── exporter.yaml
├── .gitignore
├── pyproject.toml
└── README.md
```

## 8. Documentation
The script automatically creates:
- A README.md with basic documentation
- A symlink in `python/docs/source/reference/package-apis/drivers/` pointing to the README
- Template files for all necessary components
- A good example of documentation is in `python/docs/source/reference/package-apis/drivers/gpiod.md` and also `python/docs/source/reference/package-apis/drivers/pyserial.md`

## Code Style and Testing

- Follow existing code style (validate with `make lint`, fix with `make lint-fix`)
- Perform static type checking with `make ty-pkg-${package_name}`
- Add comprehensive tests and update documentation
- Verify all tests pass (`make test-pkg-${package_name}` or `make test`)

## Contributing Guidelines

- Focus on a single issue per driver
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Reference issue numbers when applicable
- Follow conventional commit format when possible
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting PRs

# Driver client CLIs

Some drivers implement known classes that provide a CLI interface for the driver, but other
clients implement their own CLI interface that will appear in the `j` command inside a `jmp shell`.

Good examples can be found in `python/packages/jumpstarter-driver-shell/jumpstarter_driver_shell/client.py`, `python/packages/jumpstarter-driver-pyserial/jumpstarter_driver_pyserial/client.py` or `python/packages/jumpstarter-driver-probe-rs/jumpstarter_driver_probe_rs/client.py`.

# Composite drivers

Drives which have children drivers should be composite drivers, and the client interface should
inherit from `CompositeClient` in jumpstarter_driver_composite.client, also the pyproject.toml should
have a dependency on `jumpstarter-driver-composite`.
