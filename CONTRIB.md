# contrib directory
This directory contains extensions to the core codebase, community drivers and
adapter libraries and tools.

If you are working on a driver, or adapter library of general interest, please
consider submitting it to this repository, as it will become available to all
jumpstarter users.

If you are creating a driver or adapter library for a specific need, not of
general interest, or that needs to be private, please consider forking our
[jumpstarter-driver-template](https://github.com/jumpstarter-dev/jumpstarter-driver-template)


## Creating a new drivers scaffold
To create a new driver scaffold, you can use the `create_driver.sh` script in
this directory. This should help you star a new driver project with the right
structure and dependencies quickly.

From the root directory of the project, run the following command:
```shell
$ ./__templates__/create_driver.sh yepkit Ykush "Miguel Angel Ajo" "miguelangel@ajo.es"
